# ChatApp

This is loosely based on a zoom/discord hybrid clone where you can create and save different chat rooms and invite others into them. It has the capability to make use of webRTC
peer to peer data transfer to enable video calling as well.

# How to Run

Start by cloning the repo and then install the dependencies from the package-lock.json. You'll need to create your own .env file that contains a secret key
in the format ```SECRET_KEY = "YOUR SECRET KEY HERE"``` and save it into the save directory where the server.js file is. Then navigate into the client folder
and type ```npm start``` and in another terminal run ```nodemon server.js```. It should run on your local machine from there!
